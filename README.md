# Minesweeper
A basic minesweeper game on cmd (Python)

This game currently has 2 levels, beginner and intermediate. (For some reason, it would not display the Expert grid - help?)

The program was made in Windows, and was run on cmd. Any edits/suggestions for using it on any other platform are welcome.

Download the .py file and run it normally.

Once the program starts up, you will first have to choose a difficulty.
The rules are then displayed.
I have clearly demarkated the row and column numbers.
For input, enter the row number, followed by a space, followed by the column number, i.e for the cell (2,0) enter '2 0'.
Then you will need to enter c or f, for clicking and flagging, respectively.

Enjoy the game!

P.S.: Look for the Easter Eggs!
P.P.S.: I will add screenshots later, but for now I shall go to sleep
P.P.P.S: Any adaption to a GUI will also be uploaded here. 

GN!
